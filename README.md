# SkynexUI:

## Why "another component library"?
The focus of this library is to provide a common "DSL" for write UI cross platform. Doesn't matter if the platform if it's mobile or web. You will think in UI based in "Text" (`<Text>`) and "Boxes" (`<Box>`) and write the styles based in the web CSS.
